Steppy is a file that i can document the whole process in more detail...                                                                                                              <<<<<<<<<<<<<<maxRecon>>>>>>>2025>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>





For frontend, i am planning to use React app and Node.js/Express for the backend
README.md >>> project documentation     
steppy.txt personal >>> project notes
////////////////

 i am going to build the frontend homepage and a page dedicated for the tool (everything is going to be basic and can be polished later)
When it comes to backend, i will be focusing on the core functionality more and i can add other features later. For now i will focus on the scan logic, tool/library integration, error handling.
Frontend and backend integration. I will finally connect the frontend and backend, and I ll test them.
/////////////////
