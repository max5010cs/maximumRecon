# maxRecon

maxRecon is a reconnaissance tool designed to perform deep scans and analyze the outputs to identify potential weaknesses, outdated services, and other vulnerabilities. It currently uses Nmap for port scanning and service identification, with further plans to expand functionality to include other types of reconnaissance and scanning methods.

## Features (Current)

- Deep port scanning and service detection using Nmap.
- Basic analysis of Nmap output to identify potential weak services and outdated software versions.

## Plans for the Future

- Integration with multiple recon tools and scanners.
- Automated report generation from various sources of recon data.
- Identification of publicly available information that can aid in comprehensive security analysis.
- Real-time vulnerability analysis based on scan data.

## Getting Started

To run maxRecon, you will need to have the following installed:

- Node.js
- Nmap (for network scanning)
- Express (for backend API)
